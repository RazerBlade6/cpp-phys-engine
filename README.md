# C++ Physics Engine

## Goal

* To Build A Physics Engine in C++
* Currently planned to be 2D, but I may decide to have 3D rendering as well.
* This project is a planned precursor to a future project where I write my own game engine.

## Aims

* To Learn C++
* To Understand GUI Design in Linux with GLFW
* To Learn Rendering in OpenGL

## Current Status

No functionality besides generating a window.

## Notes

* I am a complete beginner to C++, GLFW, and OpenGL. Expect nothing.
